Paying by check authorizes Frontier to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from your account, as early as the day your check is received. When making an online payment, please allow time for the transfer of funds. If funds are received after the due date, you may be charged a fee, your service may be interrupted and you may incur a reconnection charge to restore service. A fee may be charged for a bank returned check. Continued nonpayment of undisputed charges (incl. 900 and long distance charges) may result in collection action and a referral to credit reporting agencies, which may affect your credit rating.
